# Application Name: My portfolio

My application is about creating portfolio by using html and CSS .My portfolio highlight my skills,education and some experiences
i a have in my field, inside my portfolio there is some projects which i have created like online butchery which sells the meat online, there is a project of online 
shopping which sells the clothes online and also my another portfolio which shows my work experience,CV and Coverletter .

My application shows all the description of my self where it shows all details of myself where it shows all things about me like my skills,my work experience,
the project i have done before and its links which explain more about it. and even where you can get me if you have any problem . the purpose of my application
is to increase my visibility and presence where i will be able to share and showcase my work easily with the employers i would like to work for. 
the usage of my application is that it is a simple or easy way to showcase your work where evereyone may see all your work experience or other things you have done
and that bring you some opportunity which you was not expecting .my application may create the great first impression for employers where If an employer sees 
your website link in your signature or on your resume, they’ll likely click on it to see what you’ve built. 
Seeing you’ve taken the time to build a website featuring work samples, recommendations, previous presentations and more will be a killer first impression. and it's another
usage is that it increase your visibility and online presence, because When an employer Googles your name, your professional portfolio will be one of the first 
search results that pops up and it can create opportunity for you.

in order to run my application or if you want to create it you first of all need the following:

- download the VScode so that you may use it in putting some code which will develop your portfolio.
- install the git and node 
- create your account on github so that you will put your project there after creating it.
- create the repository on your github account.
- start coding by using terminal to make changes of your codes after connecting it to your github account.
- After coding you publish it on github account.

in order to run my application you need to have github account so that you will enter my names and see my published application.

known bugs are: forgetting to connect your github and your project,confusing your github user name and email.creating README using the github not terminal.

some of the technology I used are: HTML and CSS
